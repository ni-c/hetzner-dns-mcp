# Build stage
#
# node:26-alpine is the ACTIVE LTS line, not the newest tag — roughly half of all
# Node majors never become LTS, so "newest" and "supported" are different things.
# Only the major belongs in this note. A patch version written here would be
# falsified by the next digest bump, which would arrive red for a reason nobody
# needs to act on. CI checks the claim instead, on every run
# (.github/scripts/check-base-image-pin.sh): `node:lts-alpine` and
# `node:26-alpine` must resolve to the same digest, and the digest pinned below
# must be a Node 26 image. The day 26 leaves LTS, that fails.

# yarn is the third package manager the base image ships and the one that keeps
# being forgotten — it lives in /opt rather than beside npm, so a line that names
# node_modules and /usr/local/bin misses it. Verify after every build:
#   docker run --rm --entrypoint sh <image> -c \
#     'ls /opt /usr/local/lib/node_modules; which yarn npm npx corepack'
